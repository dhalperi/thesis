Wenjun created this figure originally, using the octave script in this
directory (figure_5_per_link_fsf_shape_eff_plot.m)

Quoth Wenjun:

# figure was generated using expt-8-ofdm, src 3, dest 5, rate idx 6, txpower 20
# plot the fsf shape for two given links

This figure uses the data from ../fsf_shape_figure

To make it, first run make_the_figure.m to generate all the data. Then run the
gnuplot script
