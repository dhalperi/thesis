\section{Preliminary Work}
Preliminary work section that describes the system you have built so
far and/or preliminary results you have collected. Describe the
strengths and weaknesses of your approach to date, including what it can
and cannot do (or in the case of results, what those results show and
what are the limitations of your results).
