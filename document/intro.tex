%Introduction to the area and motivation for the problem(s) you propose to solve.  Include a proposed principal hypothesis that the thesis will demonstrate, and a synopsis of the likely contributions of the work.

Commodity wireless LAN technology has improved dramatically in the past decade. The low cost, small physical footprint, and minimal power consumption have led to the increasingly pervasive adoption of IEEE~802.11 (Wi-Fi) in a diverse set of consumer devices. These devices vary widely: they may be mobile or static, large or small, plugged in or battery powered; and the way these characteristics manifest can change over time depending on how devices are used. I summarize some representative commercial Wi-Fi devices in \tabref{tab:wifi-devices}.

This ubiquity of Wi-Fi, in symbiosis with the dramatically increased speeds---from 2\Mbps to 600\Mbps between 802.11 (1997) and 802.11n (2009)---has led to a recent spate of proposed applications that combine multiple of these devices. Examples of these applications include wireless system backup, wireless streaming of high definition video and audio from a Blu-ray player to an HD TV and surround sound speakers, and even pervasive interactive interfaces to the home via wireless cameras and projectors in the Microsoft Home~\cite{microsoft_home}.
