\section{Proposed work}
Proposed work section that describes the main challenges and
innovations that are needed to accomplish the proposed hypothesis, with
as much description as possible of how you will tackle each one.

\heading{Mechanisms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item capacity and isolation: operation on multiple channels via, e.g., psm
\item flexible topology: multihop communication in wireless link
\item responsiveness: mobility detection with CSI
\item discovery: capability announcement/broadcast
\end{itemize}

\heading{Capabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Admission to Wi-Fi network
\item Relay service
\item Packet Buffer
\item Fixed (e.g., same channel, always on)
\item Power state\\
\hrule
\item DNS/DHCP
\item Access to Internet
\item Media (Video/Audio/Pictures/etc. Source/Sink)
\item Input device (M, KB, Touch, Sensors)
\item Intermediary (e.g., transcoder)
\end{itemize}

\heading{Algorithms:}
\begin{itemize}
\item allocation of devices/links to channels, esp. between bands
\item decision to switch relays/etc.
\item link rate/latency/etc. estimation: what/how to feed up to applications
\item assignment of apps to protocols
\end{itemize}

\heading{Apps:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use phone as interface for instant replay streaming from DVR
\end{itemize}
