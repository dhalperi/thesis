\chapter{Further Applications of Effective SNR}
\label{chap:applications}

In the previous chapter, I showed that my Effective SNR model provides good performance when selecting rates for 802.11a/g and 802.11n links. To further illustrate the model's flexibility and power, this chapter presents my exploration of Effective SNR to various problems of wireless links and wireless networks.

\tabref{tab:esnr_uses} shows a list of several potential applications of Effective SNR, as those described in \chapref{chap:problem}. These range from optimizing various parameters of a single Wi-Fi link, such as the MCS or antenna set used, to coordinating many 802.11 nodes in a dense wireless network. Additionally, I identify applications that can be implemented by looking at other aspects of the Channel State Information below in \tabref{tab:csi_uses}. These provide useful primitives that can enable systems to adapt behavior based on the location and movement of the user. Combined, I believe these form the critical building blocks for configuring dense 802.11 networks.

\begin{table}[htp]

	\toprule
		\textbf{Application of CSI} & \textbf{Described in} \\
	\midrule
		Mobility classification & \secref{sec:esnr_mobility}\\
		Indoor localization & Sen et al.~\cite{Sen_PinLoc,Sen_SpinLoc} \\ 
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

In this chapter, I explore CSI and Effective SNR approaches to implementing four of the above applications. The first three are are selection algorithms for access points, operating channels, and multi-hop paths through networks that represent the main decisions (beyond rate) that need to be made in flexible topologies such as Wi-Fi Direct networks. The last application is to classify whether a device is mobile, to switch between algorithms designed for static vs mobile links, or trigger a search for a new, better operating point when the device begins to move.
