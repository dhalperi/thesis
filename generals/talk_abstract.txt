Title:

An efficient and reliable network architecture for the wireless home

Committee: David Wetherall, Tom Anderson, Jitu Padhye, John Zahorjan, Radha Poovendran

We have long envisioned a networked home, in which services and functionality offered by different devices can be easily shared and combined to create a new style of rich applications. With over 1 billion Wi-Fi devices shipping this year alone, these applications are becoming practical. This leads to an ongoing shift in home wireless networks from a few computers that only need to access the Internet, to a dense network of diverse consumer electronics sharing data inside the home. These trends will quickly overload the access point networks we use today.

In this talk, I will propose a network architecture for the wireless home that is efficient and reliable, so that it supports rich, demanding applications and these applications work well. The key is to add flexibility to the network topology and use more of the available spectrum to improve capacity and reduce contention between concurrent workloads. To take advantage of this flexibility, we leverage our preliminary work on Effective SNR to enable rapid and accurate configuration of links. The talk will conclude with a discussion of several avenues for further research.
