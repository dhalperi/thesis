\chapter{Application/Evaluation of Effective SNR}
\label{chap:esnr_eval}

\input{esnr_table}

In the previous chapter, we defined the Effective SNR and showed that it can effectively predict packet delivery for 802.11 rates. In this chapter, we explore applications of Effective SNR to various problems of wireless links and wireless networks.

\tabref{tab:esnr_uses} shows a list of several potential applications of Effective SNR. These range from optimizing various parameters of a single Wi-Fi link, such as the MCS or antenna set used, to coordinating many 802.11 nodes in a dense wireless network.
